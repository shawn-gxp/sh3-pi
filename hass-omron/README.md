> [!NOTE]
> Other Omron BLE devices might work by selecting a similar model during setup, but have not been formally tested. If your device does not work, please share Home Assistant debug logs and, if possible, an [Android Bluetooth stack log (HCI snoop)](#capturing-bluetooth-stack-logs-android).

## ⚠️ Warning: Conflict with Official App
**Omron blood pressure monitors only support one paired device at a time.**
If you have already paired your monitor with the official Omron Connect smartphone app, you **must unpair/forget** the device from your phone's Bluetooth settings before connecting it to Home Assistant. Using both simultaneously is not supported by the hardware.

## Installation

1. **HACS**: Add this repository (`eigger/hass-omron`) to HACS as a custom repository, or 
   **Manual**: Copy the `custom_components/omron` directory into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

- It is **strongly recommended to use a Bluetooth proxy instead of a built-in Bluetooth adapter**.  
  Bluetooth proxies generally offer more stable connections and better range, especially in environments with multiple BLE devices.

> [!TIP]
> For hardware recommendations, refer to [Great ESP32 Board for an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/great-esp32-board-for-an-esphome-bluetooth-proxy/916767/31).  
- When using a Bluetooth proxy, it is strongly recommended to **keep the scan interval at its default value**.  
  Changing these values may cause issues with Bluetooth data transmission.
- **bluetooth_proxy:** must always have **active: true**.

  Example (recommended configuration with default values):

  ```yaml
  esp32_ble_tracker:
    scan_parameters:
      active: true

  bluetooth_proxy:
    active: true
  ```
  
## Pairing & Configuration

Device setup and pairing are done entirely through the Home Assistant UI.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eigger/hass-omron/master/docs/images/pairing.jpg" width="400" alt="Pairing Mode">
</p>

1. **Enter Pairing Mode**:
   - On your Omron blood pressure monitor, press and **hold the Bluetooth button** (or the respective connection button depending on your model) for 3-5 seconds.
   - The display should show a blinking **`-P-`** symbol. This means the device is ready to pair.
2. **Add Integration**:
   - In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
   - Home Assistant should automatically discover the "Omron" device via Bluetooth. Click **Configure**.
   - If it wasn't auto-discovered, click **Add Integration** and search for "Omron".
3. **Select Your Model**:
   - Select your exact Omron model from the dropdown list.
4. **Finalize Pairing**:
   - Make sure `-P-` is still blinking on the monitor.
   - Click **Submit** in Home Assistant. 
   - HA will securely perform the pairing sequence (programming its pairing key or performing OS-level bonding).
   - The monitor screen will display an `[OK]` symbol when successful.

## How It Works

- The integration actively polls the blood pressure monitor in the background.
- Whenever you take a measurement, the device stores it in its internal EEPROM memory.
- As long as the device is in range, Home Assistant will periodically connect via Bluetooth (every 5 minutes by default) and download the latest unread records.
- HA creates automatically updated sensor entities for:
  - **Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)**
  - **Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)**
  - **Heart Rate / Pulse (bpm)**
  - **Pulse Pressure (mmHg)**
  - **Estimated Mean Arterial Pressure (mmHg)**
  - **Shock Index (ratio)**
  - **Rate Pressure Product (mmHg*bpm)**
  - **Blood Pressure Category** (ACC/AHA)
  - **Measurement Timestamp**
  - **RSSI / Signal Strength (diagnostic)**
  - **Last Poll Duration (diagnostic)**
- **Binary & Diagnostic Sensors** (Status from the last measurement):
  - **Cuff Fit**: `On` indicates the cuff was **not wrapped correctly** (improper fit).
  - **Body Movement**: `On` indicates that movement was detected during the measurement.
  - **Irregular Pulse**: `On` indicates that an irregular heart rhythm was detected.
  - **Improper Position**: `On` indicates the device was not at heart level (wrist models).
  - **Battery**: `On` when the device's batteries should be replaced.
  - **Connection**: `On` while Home Assistant is actively communicating with the monitor.

## Blood Pressure Categories (ACC/AHA)

The **Blood Pressure Category** sensor classifies readings according to the **ACC/AHA 2017 Guidelines**. If a measurement's systolic and diastolic values fall into different categories, the higher (more severe) category is assigned.

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | | Diastolic (mmHg) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Normal** | < 120 | and | < 80 |
| **Elevated** | 120 – 129 | and | < 80 |
| **Hypertension Stage 1** | 130 – 139 | or | 80 – 89 |
| **Hypertension Stage 2** | ≥ 140 | or | ≥ 90 |
| **Hypertensive Crisis** | > 180 | or | > 120 |

## Device note (text entity)

- Each integration entry exposes a **Text** entity (**Device nickname**) under *Configuration* for a free-form note. It does **not** change the Device Registry name, entity IDs, or integration options; Home Assistant restores the last value like other restore-state entities.

## User names (multi-user models) & last values

- Some Omron models store **two (or more) user profiles** on the cuff. After you choose such a model, the setup flow asks for a **display name per profile** (defaults: `user1`, `user2`, …). Those names are used in sensor labels and in the internal sensor key (slug), so they replace the old `_user1` / `_user2`-style suffix in `entity_id`s when you customize them.
- **Single-user models** do not show this step.
- **Changing a name** later under **Configure** re-creates sensors for that profile slot (new `entity_id`, new long-term statistics for those entities).
- **Last value after restart**: non-diagnostic measurement sensors restore their last recorded state from Home Assistant so they can show the previous reading when the cuff is off or not yet polled. The **Connection** binary sensor still reflects whether a poll connection is active. Stale readings are possible if the device has not synced—use the connection sensor and timestamps as context.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Pairing failed: Could not enter key programming mode`**: Make sure the device is actively showing the blinking `-P-` before clicking Submit. If it timed out and turned off, hold the button on the device to trigger `-P-` again.
- **`Connection terminated by peer`**: BLE interference or weak signal. Try moving the device closer to your Home Assistant Bluetooth adapter or use a USB extension cable for your BLE dongle.
- **Sensor values not updating**: The device turns off its Bluetooth radio to save battery. It turns on briefly after a measurement. Ensure you have taken a *new* measurement after pairing to test the sync.
- **Data doesn't show up after changing batteries**: Changing batteries may reset the internal clock on the device. Re-pairing or syncing time (via the app, then re-pairing to HA) might be necessary on older models.

## Capturing Bluetooth stack logs (Android)

To help add support for a new model, capture a Bluetooth log from your phone while using **Omron Connect** (not Home Assistant—the cuff can only pair to one device at a time).

1. **Enable Developer options**: **Settings** → **About phone** → tap **Build number** seven times.
2. **Developer options** → enable **USB debugging**.
3. **Developer options** → **Bluetooth stack log** (or **Bluetooth HCI snoop log** / **블루투스 스택 로그**) → choose **Detailed** (**Enabled** / **상세**). Do **not** use filtered mode (**필터링됨**).
4. Turn Bluetooth **off**, then **on**.
5. Pair and sync the cuff in **Omron Connect** (pairing + at least one reading sync is ideal).
6. Set **Bluetooth stack log** back to **Disabled**, then toggle Bluetooth off/on again.
7. On a PC with [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) installed, connect the phone via USB and run:

   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

   The first time, the phone may show as `unauthorized`—unlock it and tap **Allow USB debugging**, then run `adb devices` again until it shows `device`.

   ```bash
   adb bugreport
   ```

   This saves a zip in the current directory (for example `dumpstate-2026-06-17-19-37-02.zip`). With more than one device attached, add `-s <serial>` (from `adb devices`).

   Unzip the bug report and find `btsnoop_hci.log` at:

   ```
   FS/data/log/bt/btsnoop_hci.log
   ```

   (After unzip, for example: `dumpstate-2026-06-17-19-37-02/FS/data/log/bt/btsnoop_hci.log`)

8. Attach the log to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/eigger/hass-omron/issues) with your cuff model code, phone model, and Android version.
